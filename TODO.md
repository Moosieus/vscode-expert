# TODO
[ ] Replace references to Lexical with Expert.
[ ] Download nightly builds of Expert (can switch to versions later on).
[ ] Update startup to match Expert's initialization (and use the `—stdio` flag by default).
[ ] Untangle HEEx grammar. This extension should just provide Elixir and Embedded Elixir, and have HEEx grammars injected by the Pheonix Framework Extension.
[ ] Add an option to disable the language server as requested by some folks.
[ ] Add command to expressly stop and start the language server.
